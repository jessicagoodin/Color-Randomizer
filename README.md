# Color-Randomizer
Web app that randomizes color palettes

EDIT: Plans for color randomizer: 
Have a drop down menu that allows users to choose between 3 - 6 colors. 
Randomize button will randomize all colors, and clicking on each color box will freeze it if the user likes that color and wants to randomize the others. 
There will be a save option which will be available once I set up a member/login feature. 
There will be a back button in case randomize is accidentally selected (the previous random order will be stored, but just one!). 
I'd also like to store the most saved color palettes to share on a "trending" page. 
In the full "social" site, aesthetic color palettes can be shared weekly with users as inspiration. 
Photos can be uploaded to inspire color palettes.
